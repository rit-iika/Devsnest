    <div>Respected Dean,</div>
    <div>
      This is to inform you that I have enrolled in a 30 days codecamp organized
      by Devsnest Community (Devsnest is a peer learning community founded by
      the alumns of NSIT DELHI, to help students learn the actual skills.
      <a href="https://www.devsnest.in/">(visit here) </a>). The community is
      really very helpful for me to learn new skills. I am spending good time
      here in learning Data Structures and Algorithms, Web development and
      problem solving skills and building some projects.<br />
      Thus, I request you to kindly grant me leave for somedays from the ongoing
      online college classes. I'll cover all the syllabus done upto this
      week.<br />
      I would be highly obliged by this relaxation.
